# CNN-CV-assignment

The cifar-100 data set has to be present in the cifar-100-python folder for the script to read them. 
As the files are huge i couldn't upload them directly into github filder.
The model might not be complete and i didn't have time to fully run it and see the results but i implemented what i know and studied.
